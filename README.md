Reflection Questions:

Q:  What did you like about this project?
A:  It combined all the things we learnt so far

Q:  What did you struggle with in this project?
A:  I am able to grasp the logic, but not put them all together.
    I feel like I have knowledge and the roads are all built, but the bridge over river connecting all the roads are... not built.
    When I code I am very tunnel vision, and see every .java file as a separate entity

Q:  What would make your experience with this assessment better?
A:  Probably more time to practice on my own and understand how everything plays into a bigger picture.
